## Changes made in this PR

Write a summary here describing **_what_** work you did in your branch, and **_how_** you did it (explain your approach).

- [ ] A bullet of changes is okay.
- [ ] But add more detailed text than just a paste of commit messages.
- [ ] Try to attach **screenshots** wherever possible - a picture is worth 1000 words.
- [ ] An attached video, or gif, may be worth even more.
- [ ] Did you update any unit tests or automated tests to cover your changes e.g. scripts run in GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Updated the docs to cover new interface code. This could be function interface comments, or external documentation, as project-appropriate.
- [ ] Updated comments in code to explain difficult-to-read sections.

## Testing Summary

- [ ] How do reviewers build, deploy, and test your code and what should they look for that would indicate a bug or regression?
- [ ] You have tested locally. Which platforms? OS/hardware/devices/compilers used.
- [ ] Which supported platforms have you not tested on, that you need help with?
- [ ] Name specific tools have you run over the code: e.g. which { compilers, debuggers, fuzzers, profilers, sanitisers, linters, other tools }.
- [ ] Is your code covered by unit tests, and did you run these?
- [ ] What inputs did you test with to look for regressions? e.g. existing known working data, large files, empty files, etc.

## Risk Introduced and any Breaking Changes

- [ ] New dependencies: Links and licences please. This is **_extremely important!_**.
- [ ] How are new dependencies linked and built againt - .dll, inline code etc.?
- [ ] Gaps in testing: Is any code not covered by tests?
- [ ] Gaps in testing: Are you unable to test on some platform? Or is some input data not available to you for testing?
- [ ] Analyse any other potential risks.

## Personal Checklist

- [ ] Be prepared to wait for a PR to be properly reviewed, and that you may be asked for more information, or to make changes, or have the PR rejected.
- [ ] Before making your PR, refresh your branch with a merge from its parent in case of conflicting changes since you started your branch.
- [ ] Have you reviewed your own PR and checked your code?
- [ ] Have you invited a range of good reviewers?
- [ ] If you have GitHub Actions set up - does it report any errors?
- [ ] Do not merge your PR before getting at least one other reviewer's approval. Ideally wait for 2+ approvals, especially if you didn't get a thorough reivew on the first approval.
- [ ] If a reviewer asks a question, even if you have another approval, get the approval of the other reviewers as well before merging.
- [ ] If you change your code after submitting the PR, make sure existing reviewers approve the changes after you make them (review again).
- [ ] If you have a problem with the review process (e.g. it's taking too long, or the reviewers forgot) get in touch with the Team Lead of the project.
- [ ] After making your PR you may get merge conflicts - be prepared to resolve these.
